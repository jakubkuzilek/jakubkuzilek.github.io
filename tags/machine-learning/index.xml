      <description>The project aims at the development of predictive modelling methods reflecting different views (levels) of student academic path and dependencies between „resources” student interacts with during the learning process. In addition, by investigating dependencies between „educational resources” we will develop methods for the analysis of student learning behaviour. All developed methods will be tested on real data provided by partner institutions - Open University and Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, CTU in Prague.</description>
