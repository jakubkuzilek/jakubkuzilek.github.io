      <description>This post is a companion for the short paper submitted to EC-TEL 2018 conference. It contains details of the whole study and some more information such as figures, which does not fit in to the paper. For the analysis we used Open University Learning Analytics dataset.
 This is draft version of companion, if you spot an error, typo or you have any comment, please let me know.</description>

      <description>Finally, after days of struggling with bureaucracy, I managed to find enough time to complete my first blogdown project - my personal academic webpage! I must admit it blogdown is awesome and the way Hugo works is brilliant.
What seems to be problematic is to migrate all my publications list. I think I will start with that. Maybe this will be my next post in near future (hope not far futureâ€¦).</description>
