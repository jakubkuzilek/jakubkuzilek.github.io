<p>Finally, after days of struggling with bureaucracy, I managed to find enough time to complete my first <code>blogdown</code> project - my personal academic webpage! I must admit it <code>blogdown</code> is awesome and the way Hugo works is brilliant.</p>
<p>What seems to be problematic is to migrate all my publications list. I think I will start with that. Maybe this will be my next post in near future (hope not far futureâ€¦).</p>
<p>Btw. I really like the pyramid bar chart, which was included in a template file. Thus I will keep it here:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c(&#39;Sky&#39;, &#39;Sunny side of pyramid&#39;, &#39;Shady side of pyramid&#39;),
  col = c(&#39;#0292D8&#39;, &#39;#F7EA39&#39;, &#39;#C4B632&#39;),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)</code></pre>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:pie"></span>
