# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Our work aims at processing of holter ECG recordings using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This powerful tool enables us to create a adapting and robust method for detection and estimation of noise in records. Our method is fully automatic and it is easily modifiable for any type of noise. It also preserves enough information for estimation of ECG beat type, which is a desirable feature."
