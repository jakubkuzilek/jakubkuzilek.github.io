# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We continue to work on the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2011: Improving the quality of ECGs collected using mobile phones and we have developed a scoring system, which  determines the quality of recorded ECG. Our motivation was to extent the applicability of simple decision rules to support quality assessment of electrocardiogram. However, it is difficult to achieve better classification results using our approach rather than simple rules (eg, zero lead and high-amplitude artifacts) because of the inconsistency in training database. The scoring system works with standard 12 lead ECG. Our algorithm is based on four simple rules. We assessment bins of ECG using rules and results of the classification are used to calculate index quality of ECG record."
