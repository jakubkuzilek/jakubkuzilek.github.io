# Biography
I am postdoc researcher at Czech Technical University in Prague. Since completion of my Ph.D. in Biomedical Signal Processing using Blind Source Separation methods I am focusing on Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics research. This switch was caused by professor Zdenek Zdrahal from Knowledge Media Institute (Open University) who invited me to work with him on Data Mining of student data in project OU Analyse. When I returned from my 4-year long research stay in England I decided to stick with this topic and thanks to the support of CIIRC (institute I am working at), I was able to submit a grant application and received funding for continuing my research at the Czech Republic.
