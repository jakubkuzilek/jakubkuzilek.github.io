It aims at discovery of various ways to explore the student behaviour during their path throught higher education process and using the obtainedknowledge to better predict student success. Those students who might be at risk are then supported with additional help delivered via teaching staff."

The project aims at the development of predictive modelling methods reflecting different views (levels) of student academic path and dependencies between „resources” student interacts with during the learning process. In addition, by investigating dependencies between „educational resources” we will develop methods for the analysis of student learning behaviour. All developed methods will be tested on real data provided by partner institutions - Open University and
Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, CTU in Prague. To reflect educational aspects of the research we will investigate educational impact of predictive modelling outputs on study results.
