      <description>Finally, after days of struggling with bureaucracy, I managed to find enough time to complete my first blogdown project - my personal academic webpage! I must admit it blogdown is awesome and the way Hugo works is brilliant.
What seems to be problematic is to migrate all my publications list. I think I will start with that. Maybe this will be my next post in near future (hope not far futureâ€¦).</description>
